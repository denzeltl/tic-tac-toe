## Things Learned:

-   Adding `:root {}` will let you assign and create variable names with values for your css
-   The `:not()` selector on css will let you assign classes to all other elements except for the element included inside your `:not()` selector
-   Adding `{ once: true }` object on an event listener will prevent the function from running more than once
-   `e.target` will select the element that is being targeted
-   `ARRAY.some(CONDITION)` returns _true_ if at least one element in the array has met the condition
-   `ARRAY.every(CONDITION)` returns _true_ if all elements in the array has met the condition
-   `[...ELEMENTSWITHSAMECLASS]` will make it a normal array

## Todo:

-   Change to color green on winning combination
